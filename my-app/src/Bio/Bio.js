                    Starting December 2023, I have been part of the networking team at an AI Datacenter startup,
                    supporting a critical server component that serves as a foundational platform for internal teams.
                    My responsibilities include monitoring, updating, and securing network devices, as well as
                    designing secure APIs and environments to facilitate device interaction. A core focus of my
                    role has been driving automation and testing efforts, such as developing gRPC APIs for device
                    communication and building robust GitLab CI/CD pipelines to automate builds, deployments,
                    and testing workflows.

                    From December 2022 to October 2023, I worked as a backend developer on DevOps Guru,
                    an AWS service that is currently available in 16 regions. This machine learning-powered
                    service provides users with insights and remedial actions for anomalous behavior in their
                    other AWS services.

                    Our team is responsible for detecting users' AWS resources and subsequently identifying all
                    the relevant CloudWatch metrics associated with these resources. To accomplish this, we
                    utilized a series of distributed ECS clusters served through Lambda and SQS. The results
                    were then published to DynamoDB, S3, and SNS, allowing other Lambdas and ECS clusters to
                    proceed with further stages of the process. We implemented a cellular architecture for
                    the system's components. Deployments and alarms were fully automated using CDK or
                    CloudFormation templates and pipelines.

                <p className="cv-paragraph">
                    Upon completing my undergraduate degree in May 2019, I joined AWS as a member of a newly
                    established AWS Networking team in July 2019. AWS Networking is responsible for building
                    the physical and logical infrastructure that underpins all AWS services. As the second
                    developer hired onto the team, following the Senior SDE, I created and deployed the project's
                    initial infrastructure, which included API Gateway, Route53, Cognito, XRay, Lambda, Cloudwatch,
                    DynamoDB, DynamoDB streams, and S3. All of this was managed using CloudFormation templates and
                    pipelines, ensuring full integration and unit test coverage. Additionally, I took the lead in
                    designing most of the frontend using React. The project was a success, and I helped in growing
                    the development team to nine members, with most of them onboarded under my supervision. In
                    recognition of my contributions in enhancing the customer experience and code quality, I was
                    promoted in July 2021, two years after joining the team.

                <p className="cv-paragraph">
                    During the final year of my Masters program, I was hired as an Assistant System Administrator to
                    assist in managing the growing infrastructure of the Computer Science department. This involved
                    overseeing several computer labs, two server rooms, and the personal machines of research
                    professors. Through this experience, I gained valuable knowledge in server administration.

                    In the summers of 2016 and 2018, I completed internships with the Online Engineering team at
                    Take Two, a leading video game publisher under the Rockstar/2K brand. During my time with the
                    team, I collaborated on writing Python scripts to boost productivity while learning how the
                    massive GTA Online servers were managed. The internship later transitioned into the Information
                    Security team, where I received experience on corporate information security measures employed
                    to keep the service secure.

                    My journey in programming began by creating simple computers within the video game Minecraft when
                    I was 12 years old. In high school, I further honed my skills using Java to design bots that played
                    the classic video game Runescape. Through my involvement in the gaming community, I gained a
                    wealth of knowledge in Java programming and went on to develop several successful bots that
                    attracted over 10,000 users.
